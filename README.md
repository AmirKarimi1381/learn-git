# Learn Git - Deep, Conceptual, Step-by-Step

A public learning journey to master Git from the ground up - with crystal-clear concepts, real commands, and zero fluff.

This repository follows:
Inspired by the amazing Git Immersion labs --- the most conceptual Git tutorial ever created.
- Git Immersion (concept-heavy labs)
- Pro Git book (official & free)
- Real-world DevOps practices

Every lab is split into two files:
- `concepts.md` -> Why things work (the magic under the hood)
- `commands.md` -> What to type and what it actually does

Goal: Become the person in every team who truly understands Git internals, branching models, rebasing, and fixes any mess in seconds.

Contributions, corrections, and stars are very welcome!
