# Learn Git — Deep, Conceptual, Step-by-Step

A public learning journey to **truly master Git** — with crystal-clear concepts, real commands, and zero fluff.

---

## 🚀 Why this repo?

Most tutorials show **what** to type.  
This one explains **why things work.**

Inspired by:
- 🔍 Git Immersion (concept-heavy labs)
- 📘 Pro Git (official & free)
- ⚙️ Real-world DevOps practices

---

## 📂 Structure

Every topic is split into two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `concepts.md` | Understanding the internals (the real magic) |
| `commands.md` | What to type and what it actually does |

---

## 🎯 Goal

Become the person on any team who:
✔ Truly understands Git internals  
✔ Knows branching models and rebasing deeply  
✔ Can fix any Git mess — in seconds
